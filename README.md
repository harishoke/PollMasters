## Tech Stack

* **Backend:**
    * Node.js
    * Express.js
    * [@whiskeysockets/baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) (WhatsApp Web API)
    * Socket.IO (Real-time communication with frontend)
    * Pino (Logger)
* **Frontend:**
    * Python 3
    * Tkinter (Standard Python GUI library)
    * `requests` (HTTP requests)
    * `python-socketio` (Socket.IO client)
    * `Pillow` (Image processing for QR codes)
    * `qrcode` (Generating QR codes)

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (Version >= 20.0.0 recommended, as required by Baileys).
* Python 3 (Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations).
* `pip` for installing Python packages.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd PollMasters-90385d64a5a90c82e73013062db55ec42c6cdff9 
    ```
    (Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository after you upload it).

2.  **Backend Setup (Node.js):**
    Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend_node
    npm install
    cd .. 
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (Python):**
    Install the required Python packages using pip. It's recommended to do this in a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Example for creating and activating a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    # python -m venv venv
    # source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    pip install requests python-socketio Pillow qrcode
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a terminal, navigate to the `backend_node` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    cd backend_node
    node server.js
    ```
    The server will start. If you're not logged in to WhatsApp, it should print a QR code in the terminal (and also send it to the GUI once the GUI connects).

2.  **Run the Frontend GUI:**
    Open another terminal, navigate to the `frontend_python` directory (or the root `PollMasters-90385d64a5a90c82e73013062db55ec42c6cdff9` directory if `app.py` is run from there and `poll_templates.json` is also at the root), and run:
    ```bash
    # If app.py is inside frontend_python and poll_templates.json is at project root:
    # You might need to run app.py from the project root or adjust TEMPLATES_FILE path in app.py
    # Assuming you run from frontend_python and templates file is one level up:
    cd frontend_python 
    python app.py 
    ```
    The GUI application window should appear.

## Usage

1.  **Connect to WhatsApp:**
    * Once both backend and frontend are running, the frontend GUI will attempt to connect to the backend via Socket.IO.
    * Go to the "Connection" tab in the GUI.
    * If not logged in to WhatsApp on the backend, a QR code should be displayed in the GUI (it's also printed in the Node.js backend terminal).
    * Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp mobile app (Settings > Linked Devices > Link a device).
    * The status in the GUI should update, eventually showing "WhatsApp Client is READY!".

2.  **Sending Polls:**
    * Navigate to the "Poll Sender" tab.
    * Click "Refresh Chats" to load your WhatsApp chats and groups.
    * Select one or more chats/groups from the list.
    * Enter your poll question and add options (WhatsApp allows 1-12 options).
    * Check the "Allow multiple answers" box if you want users to select more than one option.
    * Click "Send Poll".

3.  **Viewing Results:**
    * Go to the "Poll Results" tab.
    * Polls sent during the current session (or fetched from the server if it was restarted with an active session) will be listed.
    * Click on a poll in the list to see its detailed results, including vote counts for each option and percentages.
    * Results should update in real-time as new votes are received by the backend.

4.  **Poll Templates:**
    * In the "Poll Sender" tab, you can save the current poll configuration (question and options) as a template using the "Save Current" button.
    * Use the dropdown menu to load an existing template. Templates are saved in `poll_templates.json`.

5.  **Logout:**
    * On the "Connection" tab, use the "Logout & Clear Session" button. This will log out the current WhatsApp account from the server and attempt to delete the local session files (`baileys_auth_info` directory).
